## 💁🏻‍♂️ Proposal

This project proposes GOYO, an AI-based spatial active noise control (ANC) system designed for IoT-enabled smart homes. Modern living spaces expose users to continuous low-frequency noise from appliances such as air conditioners and refrigerators, which gradually reduces focus and comfort during studying or remote working.

In the proposed system, each household appliance is equipped with a reference microphone and an on-device AI model that classifies its noise characteristics and broadcasts them over the home IoT network. GOYO, positioned near the user, fuses these distributed noise signatures with the sound captured by its near-ear microphones to generate localized phase-inverted control signals through its speakers.

By combining appliance-level acoustic intelligence with user-centered ANC, the system enables effective, real-time suppression of household noise without isolating the user. This proposal demonstrates the potential of an integrated spatial noise management framework to enhance concentration and auditory comfort in everyday smart home environments.
